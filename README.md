- 👋 Hi, I’m @TintedPhOx
- 👀 I’m interested in many things: swordsmanship, archery, learning, as well as 3D modeling. Unfortunately, the list is quite long so I won't write it all down now but maybe in an update later
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, basic CSS, HTML & HTML5 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment due to my current low skill level
- 📫 You can reach me the quickest on Discord: TintedPhOx#4389
